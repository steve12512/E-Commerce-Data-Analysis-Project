Obviously this is a General Data Analysis Project.
The project begins by performing ETL operations such as NULL removals, merges, and filtering. 
Then it proceeds to extract value out of data using grouping bys, and uses  Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms such as KMEANS Clustering and Association Rules. 
Fianally data is visualized using matplotlib and seaborn. 
Data is confidential and that is why neither the original excel, nor the generated xlsx and csv files have been included.


The general flow of the project can been found in the jupyter file 'main.ipynb'.
Functions.py included functions used for ETL operations and data handling.
Questions.py includes functions that generally try to answer some questions of business value.
Vizualization.py contains the functions that are used for visualization.
Models.py contains the unsupervised machine learning algorithms used for running the KMEANS and Association Rules algorithms.
